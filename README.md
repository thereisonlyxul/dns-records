# dns-records
----

This repo contains the zone file for thereisonlyxul.org. The reasoning behind making the zone file public is so that the broader community can submit pull requests to add or change records.

### Why?

Why not?!

### Can I get a sub-domain?

Yeah okay. File an issue with the records. Only one sub-domain per user/project.

### What about hosting?

Build your own infrastructure. It isn't that difficult or so we claim.

### Can I get a cert issued?

Use Let's Encrypt and the webserver method.
